# Recipe App

The main goal of this project is to improve my JavaScript skills.

<b>Note : </b>First of all, I didn't create HTML and CSS files. I implemented JavaScript.
If you want to get HTML and CSS files, you can find them [here](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/tree/master/18-forkify).
